This is a HTML/CSS project from the Odin project course. In this case, one has to create a google-search-engine web page.

- Resources:

 · Git
 · GitHub (I think you're not surprised...)
 · Vi as the editor for this text.
 · Visual Studio Code as the editor for the project with the extension Live Server.


- Webpages:

 · freecodecamp
 · w3schools
 · theodinproject 


- Purpuse of this exercise:

 · Be able to think about the structure that exists under the surface and the decorative components of it.
 · Getting familiar with the use of HTML, CSS and responsive web design (with media queries and Flexbox).


- Reflection:

It has been interesting to be able to check some intricacies that may appear when working with the media-queries since I had to be conscious of what effect I wanted to create, that is, if I wanted to work with the elements itself or with the containers (boxes).
The target for this exercise were a medium-size and mobile screens.
